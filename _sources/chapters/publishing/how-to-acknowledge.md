# How do I acknowledge the contributions of the MPIA Data Science group in my paper?


**[tl;dr]** Copy, paste and edit the text below in the acknowledgement section of your paper.


While in most cases our contributions do not raise to the level of co-authorship, we would still very much appreciate it if you could acknowledge our assistance in your published papers. In addition to just being a nice gesture, such an acknowledgement allows us to keep track of  our impact on the scientific output of the institute. We suggest the following text:


```
We acknowledge the support of the Data Science Group at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA)
and especially X, Y, Z for their invaluable assistance in [analyzing the data, developing the software,
other contributions] for this research paper.
```


Specifying names is optional but recommended especially if you received assistance from the postdocs who are part of the Data Science group.
