## How to start a software project?

This article gives basic recommendations for starting code for a project. These recommendations are also applicable to reorganizing already existing code, either your own or inherited from someone else. This article uses Python examples, but the overall advice is applicable to other languages.

[tl;dr] Separate code, data, tests and documentation. Follow standard practices (see below). Build standard practices into your workflow (writing doc strings and tests, linting, etc.) rather than postponing them to the end.
