**DRAFT**


- Color-cycle picker for colorblind friendly color schemes: https://colorcyclepicker.mpetroff.net/
- https://colorbrewer2.org/ which has a “colorblind safe” option.
- For matplotlib, great packages for perceptually unifom colourmaps are cmocean (https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/) and colorcet (https://colorcet.holoviz.org/)
- I also use the Okabe Ito scale a lot (google will give the RGB values and implementations for multiple programming languages).
- And this is my favorite tool for checking if a choice of colors actually works https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/
- Paper for the Okabe Ito work: https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/
- My python implementation: https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/0bc11f7fb56c43a088a0/
